## About
**Note for job applications** I was required to complete this project in Stata instead of Python, which I would typically code in. However, I chose to submit this project because I completed it solo and particularly enjoyed the topic and analysis in comparison to other projects I have done. If you would like to see Python code of mine, please check out my public repo called "Data Science Group Project". 

This repo contains a research project I completed for EDUC1765: Policy and Program Evaluation at Brown University, taught by Professor Pierre De Galbert. The assignment was to replicate an existing paper and extend it to build a new argument that investigated the same issue from a new angle.

The completed paper can be found in [EDUC1765_Final Paper](</Telesecundaria Project/EDUC1765_ Final Paper.pdf>) . 

The files [Table_1](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_1.do>), [Table_2](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_2.do>), and [MTE](</Telesecundaria Project/MTE.do>), contain Stata code for their respective figures in the paper.
