**Note for job applications:** I was required to complete this project in Stata instead of Python, which I would typically code in. However, I chose to submit this project because I find it to be particularly interesting and am proud of the result. I completed this project by myself under the guidance of Professor Pierre De Galbert. If you would like to see a Python project, please check out my public repo called ["Data Science Group Project"](https://github.com/colbster5/Data-Science-Group-Project). 

## About

This repo contains a research project I completed for EDUC1765: Policy and Program Evaluation at Brown University, taught by Professor Pierre De Galbert. The assignment was to replicate an existing paper and extend it to build a new argument that investigated the same issue from a new angle.

The completed paper can be found in [EDUC1765_Final Paper](</Telesecundaria Project/EDUC1765_ Final Paper.pdf>) . 

The files [Table_1](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_1.do>), [Table_2](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_2.do>), and [MTE](</Telesecundaria Project/MTE.do>), contain Stata code for their respective figures in the paper. Table 1 and Table 2 contain descriptive statistics and MTE contains marginal treatment effect analysis.
