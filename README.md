## About
This repo contains a research project I completed for EDUC1765: Policy and Program Evaluation at Brown University, taught by Professor Pierre De Galbert. The assignment was to replicate an existing paper and extend it to build a new argument that investigated the same issue from a new angle.

The completed paper can be found in [EDUC1765_Final Paper](</Telesecundaria Project/EDUC1765_ Final Paper.pdf>) . 

The files [Table_1](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_1.do>), [Table_2](</Telesecundaria Project/Table_2.do>), and MTE
